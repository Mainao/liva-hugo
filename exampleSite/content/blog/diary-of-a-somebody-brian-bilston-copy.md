The pseudonymous Brian Bilston’s life seems, by all accounts, to be unexciting. His ex-wife has taken up with a new man and his relationship with his son is unsatisfactory. He is frustrated with his job where he needs to continue struggling with spreadsheets and management jargon.

So this new year Brian has a resolution. He decides to write a poem every day a year in his diary figuring it will carry a change and improvement to his life.

How the everyday mundane was transformed into witty poems and hilarious diary entries is what makes this book so wonderful to read.

The use of clever wordplay, puns, and rhymes leaves you smiling and giggling.

Along with humour, there’s additionally a bit of mystery in it. 

Funny and poignant at the same time, Diary of a Somebody is a brilliantly written book.
